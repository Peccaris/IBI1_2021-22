but with similar populations. Plot the total number of COVID cases over time in all 
three countries.

Answerï¼š
line 71-88

Results:
Accroding to the plot, total cases surged from late February to the end of March in South Korea. But the rate of growth slowed after March 10th. This shows that February to March in 2020 was the outbreak period of COVID-19 in South Korea
The COVID-19 situation in Kenya is not as severe as the other two countries, both in terms of growth rate and total number of cases. In the plot, the curve of total cases in Kenya is rather flat with only a slight upward trend. So at least in March of 2020, the COVID-19 was still under control in Kenya.
For Colombia, the total cases remained zero until the middle of March, and there was an upward trend. The outbreak in Colombia began in mid-March of 2020.
