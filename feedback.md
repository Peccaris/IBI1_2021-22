For week 4 practical, I got 100 scores.

For week 5 practical, the feedback shows that " wrong content on file". After checking my file, I found
I pushed the wrong file which doesn't have any code about this practical. So I wrote this practical again
and compared with other students whose code is 100 scores. Then I pushed it and wrote down this feedback
on my notebook. Additionally, another feedback says "and print the last element", so I reviewed the practical 
guidence and completed the comment accroding to the requirements.

For week 6, I also got 100 scores. But there is one feedback saying "avoid using symbols in file name", so I 
changed my file name " Rob's marks" into " The marks of Rob", and also wrote down this feedback in my notebook
to remind myself.
